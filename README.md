# Smart Planner
### Project Description
Do you constantly find it difficult to organize your timetable efficiently and miss deadlines? Do you want to keep track of different events coming up and be reminded in advance? These problems are very common and are faced by almost everyone in day to day life. While many applications exist which let us set reminders or make our timetable, but our project is a one stop solution to all of this.It contains all the necessary features wrapped up in a UI that is user friendly and very easy for anyone to use.

It is more than a scheduler, it lets you schedule your days according to your needs and visualize it later for easy reference. The user can plan and keep track of the tasks according to the deadlines so no deadline is ever missed!

The distinguishing feature about our application is a voice assistant integrated into it which can help you schedule your tasks, so now you can speak your whole timetable and the assistant will organize it according to your needs.Also the assistant will help in answering questions like what deadlines are upcoming, tasks left to be completed , about the events of the day and much more. Add your own media(photos, videos and voice notes) to your planner. 

View your productivity(completed tasks) , make to-do lists , share your timetable are just some of the small features integrated into this application.The work will be divided equally among the people in this project and proper deadlines will be kept to ensure that application is build timely.

In future versions of this application, calendars can be shared among different people and tasks can be collaborated on for team project deadlines.The future scope of the voice assistant includes adding ‘smart vision’ which plans tasks according to the deadlines for you and suggests the order for completion.

### Technologies

The tech stack that we plan to use in this application includes

1. Figma for UI/UX
2. Kotlin for Android app development
3. Python for ML model of voice assistant

We have a basic idea of these tech stack while we will learn more about it as the project is in development.

The following diagram shows the flow of the application that we hope to build
